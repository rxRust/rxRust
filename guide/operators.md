# Operators

rxRust provides a comprehensive set of operators to transform, filter, and combine streams. These operators are the building blocks of reactive programming, allowing you to compose complex asynchronous logic in a declarative and readable way.

## Learning Operators: Marble Diagrams

To understand how each operator works, we highly recommend consulting the [ReactiveX.io](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html) documentation. It provides interactive "Marble Diagrams" which are visual representations of how an Observable (represented by a stream of marbles) is transformed by an operator over time. rxRust operators generally follow the same behavior as their ReactiveX counterparts.

For exact Rust function signatures and implementation details, please refer to the **[API Documentation](https://docs.rs/rxrust)**.

## Rust-Specific Considerations

While the behavior of operators is largely consistent with ReactiveX, their usage in Rust comes with unique considerations due to Rust's ownership and borrowing rules, as well as its type system. When using operators, pay close attention to:

*   **Ownership and Moves**: Many closures passed to operators will move captured variables. If you need to use a variable across multiple closures or after the Observable chain, you might need to `clone()` it or use `Arc`/`Rc` for shared ownership.
*   **Borrowing**: Ensure that data borrowed by closures lives long enough. The compiler will guide you on this.
*   **`Clone` Trait**: For operators that might re-emit values (e.g., multicast or buffer operations), the item type `T` often needs to implement `Clone`.
*   **Context Compatibility**: Remember that `Local` context streams are optimized for single-threaded usage (using `Rc`), while `Shared` context streams require types to be `Send + Sync` (using `Arc`) to safely work in multi-threaded environments.

## Operator Reference

### Creation Operators

Operators that originate new Observables. These are typically factory methods available on `Local`, `Shared`, or your custom `Context`.

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `of` | Emits a single value and then completes. |
| `from_iter` | Converts an `IntoIterator` (e.g., `Vec`, `Range`) into an Observable. |
| `from_future` | Converts a `Future` into an Observable that emits its result. Variants exist for `_with` custom schedulers and `_result` for `Future<Output=Result<T,E>>`. |
| `from_stream` | Converts an async `Stream` into an Observable. Variants exist for `_with` custom schedulers and `_result` for `Stream<Item=Result<T,E>>`. |
| `from_fn` | Creates an Observable that emits a single value generated by a function at subscription time. |
| `interval` | Emits sequential numbers at regular time intervals. Use `interval_with` for custom schedulers. |
| `timer` | Emits a single item after a specified delay. Variants exist for `_with` custom schedulers and `_at` a specific instant. |
| `defer` | Creates an Observable that calls a factory function to generate a new Observable for each subscriber. |
| `create` | Creates an Observable from scratch by providing a function that defines the subscription logic with an `Emitter`. |
| `empty` | Emits no items and immediately completes. |
| `never` | Emits no items and never completes. |
| `throw_err` | Emits no items and immediately errors. |
| `subject` | Creates a new `Subject` (multicasting source, hot observable). Use `subject_mut_ref` for mutable reference broadcasting. |
| `behavior_subject` | Creates a new `BehaviorSubject` (multicasting, replays last value). Use `behavior_subject_mut_ref` for mutable reference broadcasting. |
| `merge_observables` | Merges multiple observables concurrently, subscribing to all at once. |
| `concat_observables` | Concatenates multiple observables sequentially, subscribing one at a time. |

### Transformation Operators

Operators that transform the items emitted by an Observable.

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `map` | Applies a function to each item emitted. |
| `map_to` | Maps every emission to a constant value. |
| `filter_map` | Maps and filters items in one step (using `Option`). |
| `scan` | Applies an accumulator function to each item, emitting each intermediate result. |
| `reduce` | Applies an accumulator function and emits only the final result. |
| `flat_map` | Projects each item to an Observable, then merges them all. |
| `concat_map` | Projects each item to an Observable, then concatenates them (preserving order). |
| `buffer` | Collects items into a `Vec` until a notifier emits. |
| `buffer_count` | Collects items into a `Vec` of a specific size. |
| `buffer_time` | Collects items into a `Vec` for a specific duration. |
| `pairwise` | Groups consecutive emissions into pairs `(prev, current)`. |
| `group_by` | Divides an Observable into a set of Observables that each emit a different group of items. |

### Filtering Operators

Operators that selectively emit items from the source Observable.

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `filter` | Emits only items that satisfy a predicate. |
| `take` | Emits only the first `n` items. |
| `take_last` | Emits only the last `n` items. |
| `take_while` | Emits items as long as a predicate is true. |
| `take_until` | Emits items until another Observable emits. |
| `skip` | Skips the first `n` items. |
| `skip_last` | Skips the last `n` items. |
| `skip_while` | Skips items as long as a predicate is true. |
| `skip_until` | Skips items until another Observable emits. |
| `distinct` | Suppresses duplicate items. |
| `distinct_until_changed` | Suppresses consecutive duplicate items. |
| `debounce` | Emits an item only after a specific timespan has passed without another emission. |
| `throttle` | Emits the first item emitted during a time window. |
| `sample` | Emits the most recent item when another Observable emits. |
| `last` | Emits only the last item. |
| `contains` | Emits true if the Observable emits a specific item. |

### Combination Operators

Operators that work with multiple source Observables to create a single Observable.

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `merge` | Interleaves items from multiple Observables. |
| `zip` | Combines items from multiple Observables pairwise. |
| `combine_latest` | Combines the latest item from each Observable whenever any emits. |
| `with_latest_from` | Merges the current item with the latest item from another Observable. |
| `start_with` | Emits a sequence of items before beginning to emit the items from the source. |
| `merge_all` | Flattens a Higher-Order Observable by merging inner Observables. |
| `concat_all` | Flattens a Higher-Order Observable by concatenating inner Observables sequentially. |

### Utility Operators

Operators for observing, timing, and error handling.

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `tap` | Performs a side effect for every emission (next, error, complete). |
| `delay` | Shifts the emissions forward in time by a specified delay. |
| `delay_subscription` | Delays the moment of subscription. |
| `observe_on` | Specifies the Scheduler on which an observer will observe this Observable. |
| `subscribe_on` | Specifies the Scheduler on which the subscription will happen. |
| `finalize` | Registers a callback to be called when the Observable terminates. |
| `retry` | Resubscribes to the source Observable if it signals an error. |
| `map_err` | Transforms the error type. |
| `on_error` | Performs a side effect if an error occurs. |
| `on_complete` | Performs a side effect if the Observable completes. |
